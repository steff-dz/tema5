Here are just some notes from school from Thursday 28, January. 

-- might want to load the page info with a useEffect that listens to pageData state
-- make a different component for plotly. 

-- I should consider not making 2 different calls to Cosmic in the guide page for guide and map; combine them som how and evaluate if I need that guide page at all.




QUESTIONS: 
-- do ALL components have to be totally re-useable? If they are not, should I put them maybe in a different folder, call them something else?
-- Our project can be many pages, right? We dont need to put the map and info-graphs in the same page?
-- we need to put a graph/infograph thing AS a mapmarker popup???
